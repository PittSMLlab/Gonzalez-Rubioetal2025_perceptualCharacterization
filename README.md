# Characterizing human perception of speed differences in walking: Insights from a Drift
Diffusion Model

# data organization
Original data from the experiment (Datlog .mat files) were converted to .csv and made available. Resulting csv files ARE stored on each subject's /data/ subfolder. There are two types of files: the ones named 'SlowX.csv' store a table in csv format, and contain summary information about each of the trials in each block. 
Original data from experiment (.mat files) will be made available upon request. 

# analysis
First, add the /src/ folder to Matlab's path.
The monoLS toolbox is also needed for some analyses, find at github.com/pabloi/monoLS and add to path.
Figures 2 and 3 can be reproduced through Characterization Analysis.m 
Figure 4 can be reproduced through the DDM RT fit.ipynb and utils.py files.
